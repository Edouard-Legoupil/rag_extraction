Lack of clear data requirements determination by UNHCR: The evaluation focuses on UNHCR\u2019s practice around data, including data collected by operational partners when the data and information requirements are determined by UNHCR. However, there is no mention of whether these requirements are clearly defined or communicated to the implementing partners (UNHCR and/or implementing partners. 4.2 Key Evaluation Questions (KEQs) 17).\n2. Limited scope of evaluation: The evaluation only covers four case studies of UNHCR country/regional operations, which may not be representative of the broader data and information management practices within UNHCR (4.2 Key Evaluation Questions (KEQs) 17).\n3. Exclusion of broader data and IM practices by UNHCR as a lead agency in the Global Clusters: The evaluation does not cover the broader data and information management practices by UNHCR as a lead agency in the Global Clusters, which could be relevant to understanding the organization\u2019s overall approach to data and information management (4.2 Key Evaluation Questions (KEQs) 17).\n\nThese risks and difficulties may affect my ability to provide evidence and recommendations that will inform UNHCR\u2019s IM systems and practice, particularly in terms of people and culture organizational enablers such as management practices, technical approach, business processes, staffing allocation or capacity building (2.1 Purpose)."

The evaluation team observed these gaps in information sharing and engagement with persons of concern (4.7, 75). This limits UNHCR's ability to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies for voluntary repatriation and sustainable reintegration.\n\nAdditionally, the global context that UNHCR operates in, including the growth of personal access to information, increased levels of displacement globally, and limited availability of funds, creates the need for UNHCR to adapt its data practices (23).

The lack of a coherent data transformation strategy and roadmap, including enforcing data norms and standards, cultivating strong data leadership, developing systems to integrate and pull data together, creating a data-first culture, and building capacities and confidence around statistics and evidence on persons of concern, poses a risk to the effective identification and addressing of the well-being and basic needs of refugees (9 UNHCR Recommendations).\n2. Difficulty in shifting from output-based management to outcome-focused monitoring: The current corporate results-based management tool, FOCUS, primarily reports on outputs. However, UNHCR recognizes the need for more outcome-focused monitoring leading to longer-term impact (1.3.5 Revamping UNHCR\u2019s results-based management approach). This shift might present challenges in measuring and ensuring improvements in well-being and basic needs at the operational level.\n\nThese risks and difficulties are directly related to my area of expertise, as effective data management and outcome-focused monitoring are essential for identifying, addressing, and measuring improvements in the well-being and basic needs of refugees."

Improving data and information management could help to better inform policies and programs aimed at empowering communities and achieving gender equality.\n* Secondly, the context highlights the need for UNHCR to prioritize investments in data integration, capacities, and norms and standards (24). This could be particularly relevant for my area of focus, as more comprehensive and standardized data can help to ensure that community empowerment and gender equality initiatives are effectively designed, implemented, and monitored.\n* Thirdly, the evaluation notes the need for UNHCR to revamp its results-based management approach (22). A more outcome-focused monitoring system could help to better track progress towards achieving gender equality and empowering communities, and ensure that resources are being used effectively.\n\nOverall, these takeaways suggest that there is a need for UNHCR to prioritize improvements in data and information management, as well as revamp its results-based management approach, in order to better achieve its goals related to community empowerment and gender equality.\n\nSource:\n13.

Based on this evaluation, the gap between what UNHCR wants and where it currently is not that stark. There are some straightforward, and not-so-difficult fixes that can help UNHCR become more efficient and have more aggregated data visualized and accessible.

Additionally, the specific external change of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants of September 2016 has called upon UNHCR to develop and initiate the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), which recognizes that sustainable assistance and durable solutions for refugees cannot be achieved without international cooperation. The CRRF seeks to ease the pressure on host countries, enhance refugee self-reliance, expand access to third-country solutions, and support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity (context paragraph 1.4.1).\n\nIn terms of internal changes, UNHCR is facing a profound effect on its data and information needs due to the growing scope and complexity around persons of concern, who are increasingly finding refuge in urban areas with social networks, greater education, and economic opportunities (context paragraph 1.4.2). This change requires UNHCR to adapt its data practices and engage in wider and deeper partnering with local authorities and service providers, as well as increased sophistication around new ways of determining the needs of persons of concern and activities (e.g. the \"big data\" of social media) (context paragraph 1.4.2).\n\nTherefore, it is clear that UNHCR's current situation is rooted in both external and internal changes, as well as the constantly changing environment that it operates in.
