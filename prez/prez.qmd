## Current Challenge

Considering the [number of published evaluation reports](https://www.uneval.org/evaluation/reports){target="_blank"} across the UN system, **information retrieval and evidence generalization challenges** have arisen.

::: notes
The key deliverable from an evaluation process is usually a long report (*often over 60 pages PDF file*). From this report, two-pagers executive "briefs" are usually designed for the consumption of the senior executive audience. Striking the balance between concise and informative can be tricky but what remains even more challenging is the subjective dimension involved in

The potential fear of being, like *Cassandra* in the greek mythology, the bearer of bad news comes with the structural risk of "cushioning" the real evaluation findings to a point where they get hidden.

## RAG at Rescue!

**Retrieval Augmented Generation** (RAG) combines the strengths of retrieval-based large language models & generative large language models.

Embeddings are generated **numeric representations of text data**
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
![](img/RAG_workflow.png){fit-align="center"}
:::

::: notes
Mechanism: - Retrieval: Fetches relevant documents or information from a knowledge base. - Generation: Generates responses based on retrieved documents and user queries.

Benefits: - Enhanced accuracy and relevance of generated responses. - Effective in scenarios with vast, dynamic information sources.

Text embedding models are statistical methods that represent text as numerical vectors. These embeddings aim to capture the semantic meaning of words and phrases in an efficient and user-friendly manner. They find applications in various natural language processing tasks and are constantly evolving.

## Builing a RAG Pipeline requires:

1.  **Data Collection**: Select & Gather relevant reports.

2.  **Model Testing**: Test different generative and retrieval large language models.

3.  **Integration**: Combine models & functions into a cohesive pipeline.

4.  **Validation**: Build a human-baseline to benchmark the performance of the integrated system.

5.  **Evaluation**: Assess accuracy, relevance, and efficiency using predefined metrics.

::: notes
Pipeline Components: - Retrieval Module: Efficiently searches and retrieves relevant documents. - Generative Module: Generates coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

Testing: - Ensure the retrieval accuracy. - Validate the quality and relevance of generated content.

Evaluation Metrics: - Precision, recall, and F1 score for retrieval accuracy. - BLEU, ROUGE, and human evaluation for generation quality.

::: notes
**Components** - **Accuracy Metrics**: Measure how well the model's outputs align with the correct answers. - **Relevance Metrics**: Evaluate the pertinence of the retrieved documents to the query. - **Efficiency Metrics**: Assess the computational resources and time required for the process. - **User Feedback**: Incorporate qualitative feedback from users to refine the model.

## Organising Validation with Human Feedback Loop

Incorporate ongoing feedback from users to continuously improve model performance.

-   **Task-Specific Fine Tuning**: Adjust models based on specific application requirements and domain knowledge.
-   **Alignment Fine Tuning**: Ensure that model outputs align with ethical guidelines and user expectations.

::: notes
Human-in-the-Loop: Integrate human expertise to refine and improve model performance. Focus on aligning AI outputs with specific tasks and user requirements. Continuous feedback loop for model adjustments and enhancements.

Task-Specific Fine-Tuning: Customize models for specific tasks or domains. Improve model accuracy and relevance in specialized applications. Use active learning techniques to optimize the feedback loop.

Alignment Fine-Tuning: Ensure model outputs align with user expectations and ethical standards. Regularly update and validate against evolving guidelines.

## AI Deployment: Buy or Build?

![](img/GL0vYd_WcAAqUDZ.png){fit-align="center"}

::: notes
```         
Buying:
```

Quick implementation with vendor support. Cost-effective for standard applications. Limited customization options. Building: Full control over customization and integration. Higher initial investment but tailored to specific needs. Requires in-house expertise and ongoing maintenance.
:::

## Some Considerations

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   **Total Cost of Ownership**: Off-the-shelves "production-level" solutions do not exist. The real challenge is to correctly balance outsourcing vs insourcing.
-   **Modular Customization**: The "*orchestration*" solution should be flexible to adapt itself to incoming new development, without changing everything.
-   **Agility - Iterate & Deliver**: Adopt short development round to test with users.
-   **Information Formatting**: Promote specific format for report publication, specifically Markdown rather than PDF, to ease the ingestion of content by the models.
-   **Expertise & Training**: Need to nurture in-house awareness and expertise to understand how RAG works, to test and then to help building validation dataset.

## Conclusions

Blind trust in AI definitely comes with **serious risks to manage**. And at first on one side, the lack of transparency and explainability and on the other side the occurrence and reproduction of bias and discrimination.

Trust building will therefore require **organizational commitment to control**:

-   the performance of information retrieval (*RAG*);\
-   the ground truthing and alignment of model outputs (*Fine-tuning*).
