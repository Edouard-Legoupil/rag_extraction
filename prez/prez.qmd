## Current Challenge


Considering the [numbers of published evaluation reports](https://www.uneval.org/evaluation/reports) across the UN system, **information retrieval and evidence generalization challenges** have arisen:

 How to extract the most relevant findings and recommendations from within a specific context and to reuse and re-inject them in a different but appropriate context?


## The [fifth wave](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0253-6) of the **evidence revolution** is triggered by AI

 Relying on automated retrieval can help improving the objectivity and independence of the evaluation report summarization.

The key deliverable from an evaluation process is usually a long report (*often over 60 pages PDF file*). From this report, two-pagers executive "briefs" are usually designed for the consumption of the senior executive audience. Striking the balance between concise and informative can be tricky but what remains even more challenging is the subjective dimension involved in

 The potential fear of being, like *Cassandra* in the greek mythology, the bearer of bad news comes with the structural risk of "cushioning" the real evaluation findings to a point where they get hidden.
